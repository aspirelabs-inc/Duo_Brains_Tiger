### Problem Statement
##### Graph for better world. 

Duo needs to be able to learn from changes to the UI and predict user actions to learn a task.

The Brains is responsible for this. It observes data from the UI Layer and determines how to represent them as queries on the Knowledge Graph before predicting following user actions.





<a name="Overview"/>

## Overview:
The Brains is divided into 3 layers:
- The Translation Layer communicates with the UI Layer.
- The Observation Layer manages disambiguation, UI updates, and error handling (during task executing).
- The Data layer manages query generation and predictions.

## Installation:

## Usage:

In order to run the full Duo Poc, you will need to have both the Brains and the UI layer running.

Go to the [UI Layer Repository](https://github.com/aspirelabs-inc/DuoPoc-UI-Layer.git) for setup instructions if needed.

You can also simulate data from the UI Layer by creating proto objects for testing. There is an example of how to do this at the bottom of the server.py file.
